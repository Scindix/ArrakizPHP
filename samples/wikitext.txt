"""I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I could plan for it...I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...I don't want to sound like I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have.

I just haven't - you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one.|George Bush"""

You can also format by using split container:
||Split text 1. I'm not quite sure, what to write. :-(||I'm really not sure ... Maybe I should use a Lorem ipsum genererator!||({Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr,

sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam})





You can also use tables:



|=Heading 1|=  Heading 2  |=Heading3
|Cell 1.1  | Cell 1.2 |Cell 1.3
| Cell 2.1| Cell 2.2
